# Dhara - A Modern Streaming App

Dhara is a modern streaming application built with **Electron**, **HLS.js**, and **Plyr**. It allows users to stream live TV channels, manage favorites, and search for channels effortlessly. The app is designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and highly customizable. 

**Disclaimer**: Dhara is merely a wrapper and a fun project. It does not host any content itself and is not intended to harm or infringe on any copyrights. All channel links and data are sourced from third-party repositories, and Dhara acts as a front-end interface for streaming.

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the App
To start the app in development mode, use the following command:
```bash
npm start

## Building for Production

To package the app for production, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Electron Forge
If you haven't already installed Electron Forge globally, do so with:
```bash
npm install -g @electron-forge/cli
```

### Step 2: Package the App
Run the following command to package the app for your current platform:
```bash
npm run package
```

This will create a distributable package in the `out` directory.

### Step 3: Create Installers
To create platform-specific installers (e.g., `.exe`, `.dmg`, `.deb`), use:
```bash
npm run make
```

The installers will be generated in the `out/make` directory.

## Customization

### Adding Channels
To add or modify channels, update the `channels` array in the `index.html` file. Each channel should have the following structure:
```json
{
  "name": "Channel Name",
  "logo": "https://path-to-logo.png",
  "link": "https://path-to-stream.m3u8",
  "userAgent": "Custom User-Agent",
  "cookie": "Custom Cookie"
}
```

### Changing the App Icon
Replace the icons in the `icon/` directory with your own. Ensure the filenames remain the same:
- `icon.ico` (Windows)
- `icon.png` (Linux/macOS)

### Modifying Styles
The app's styles are defined in the `<style>` block within `index.html`. You can customize the colors, fonts, and layout as needed.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. HLS Playback Issues
- Ensure the stream URL is valid and accessible.
- Check the browser console for any HLS-related errors.
- If using Safari, ensure the stream supports native HLS playback.

### 2. Build Errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly by running `npm install`.
- If the build fails, try clearing the `node_modules` directory and reinstalling dependencies:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install
  ```

### 3. App Crashes on Launch
- Check the terminal for any error messages.
- Ensure the `main.js` file is correctly configured and points to the right HTML file.
